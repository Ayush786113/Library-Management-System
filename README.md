# Library-Management-System
A simple and very basic library management system.

This is a library management system made using Java Swing and in Eclipse IDE. It includes a dedicated and integrated SQLite database for data management. The key features in this program include:
1) To add new books in the database
2) To add new members in the database
3) To lend any book to any member (one book and one member at a time) and mark the book as 'Unavailable' in the database
4) To return lended books and update the status of the book as 'Available'
5) To view a tabular representation of books in the library, members registered, and details of the borrowed books (book name, member name, borrow date)
6) To update the personal information of the members

Currently it does not have any authentication system but can be implemented upon requirement.
